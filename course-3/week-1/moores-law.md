# Moore’s Law

It’s an observation, not a physical law. It predicted that the number of transistors (density) would double every 2 years which lead to exponential increase in speed.
It has its limitations as more transistors require more power (power wall).

Even though smaller transistors use less power, density is scaling faster, so power consumptions is increased.
Also,  high power leads to higher temperatures, which is a bigger limitation as if it isn’t dissipated, it will melt a chip

Dynamic Power is described by:


` P = α * C F V^2 `

Voltage is the key factor here.

It should scale with transistor size (Dennard Scaling), however it can’t go forever. I can’t go too low, it must stay above a threshold voltage, also noise should be consider.
