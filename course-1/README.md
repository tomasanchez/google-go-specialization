# Getting Started with Go


## About this Course

Learn the basics of Go, an open source programming language originally developed by a team at Google and enhanced by
many contributors from the open source community. This course is designed for individuals with previous programming
experience using such languages as C, Python, or Java, and covers the fundamental elements of Go. Topics include data
types, protocols, formats, and writing code that incorporates RFCs and JSON. Most importantly, you’ll have a chance to
practice writing Go programs and receive feedback from your peers. Upon completing this course, you'll be able to
implement simple Go programs, which will prepare you for subsequent study at a more advanced level.
