# Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go

## About this Course

Continue your exploration of the Go programming language as you learn about functions, methods, and interfaces.
Topics include the implementation of functions, function types, object-orientation in Go, methods,
and class instantiation. As with the first course in this series, you’ll have an opportunity to create your own Go
applications, so you can practice what you’re learning.
